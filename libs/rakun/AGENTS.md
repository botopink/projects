A **Spring-style application framework** for botopink — an IoC container with
constructor dependency injection plus a declarative web layer (`#[restController]`
+ route annotations). **Opt-in, never auto-loaded:** it enters a module's scope
only via `from "rakun"`. **The compiler core knows nothing about rakun** — every
behaviour is plain botopink + a host runtime, on the generic annotation-processor
mechanism (`@Decl` reflection, comptime decorator bodies, `@emit`).

How the wiring works: each component decorator (`decorators.bp`) is a comptime fn
over the annotated record. It `@emit`s, at the application site, (1) a scan
self-registration and (2) a factory `__rkMake_<Type>()` that constructs the record
injecting each field by its own factory; a controller additionally `@emit`s one
route registration per mapped method (reading `decl.methods` + the `#[route]`
prefix). botopink has no top-level mutable state, so the registries those calls
feed — the scan list, the dependency-cycle guard, the router table — live in
`runtime.mjs`, reached through the `#[@external]` declarations in `runtime.bp`.
The emitted code references those runtime fns by name, so a module declaring
components also imports them (`import {service, rkScan, rkEnter, rkDone,
rkRegisterRoute, …} from "rakun"`). The HTTP value types are real emitted code
(`http.bp`); the boundary interfaces stay declaration-only (`rakun.d.bp`).

## Module tree (`root.bp`)

`src/root.bp` is the explicit module-tree root — the package builds from it, not
a deprecated blind `src/` scan. It declares the three compiled modules
`pub mod decorators; pub mod http; pub mod runtime;` (all public surface, reached
via `from "rakun"`; the `@emit`ted wiring imports the runtime fns by name). The
boundary declaration module `rakun.d.bp` is **not** in the tree: it is wired
through `botopink.json` `files` (consumer surface, loaded with `.declaration =
true` for a consumer). `.d.bp` modules are not resolved by `mod` paths (the
resolver follows only `<name>.bp` / `<name>/mod.bp`), mirroring how `libs/std`
keeps its ambient `.d.bp` out of `root.bp`.

## Design at a glance

- **IoC container** — components (`#[component]`/`#[service]`/`#[repository]`/
  `#[controller]`/`#[restController]`) are scanned at module load; each gets an
  emitted factory `__rkMake_<Type>()`.
- **Constructor injection** — a dependency is declared as a `record` field and
  resolved **by type** (the factory calls the field type's own factory).
  Immutable-first: no setter/field injection. (`#[value("key")]` property
  injection is a recorded follow-up; v1 injects every field by type.)
- **Cycle detection** — `__rkMake_X` brackets construction with `rkEnter`/`rkDone`;
  a cycle A→B→A raises at first construction. (A *comptime* cycle diagnostic would
  need a whole-graph view no single decorator has — a recorded follow-up.)
- **Web layer** — `#[restController, route(prefix)]` + `#[getMapping(path)]`/… emit
  a `rkRegisterRoute(verb, prefix + path, handler)`; `rkDispatch` matches (verb,
  path) — including `:name` params — and runs the handler over `Request`/`Response`,
  or 404s.
- **Bootstrap** — `Rakun.run(App(port: 8080))` reads the router back and starts the
  server (the real HTTP backing needs `libs/server` to graduate from scaffold; the
  runtime `.mjs` must also be shipped next to the emitted module for a consumer
  build — both recorded follow-ups).

## Conventions

- **`.bp` over `.d.bp`.** Logic lands in real emitted `.bp` (`http.bp`,
  `runtime.bp`'s `declare fn`s, `decorators.bp` bodies). Only the boundary
  interfaces (`Request`/`Context`/`Rakun`) stay declaration-only in `rakun.d.bp`.
- **Host state behind `#[@external]`.** The one mutable seam is `runtime.mjs`; the
  core never sees it. Decorator bodies obey the comptime constraints (no sibling
  calls, `if`-expr, bare-`if` only last, block-lambdas) — see
  [`../../modules/compiler-core/src/comptime/AGENTS.md`](../../modules/compiler-core/src/comptime/AGENTS.md).
- **Imported, not prelude.** Reached via `from "rakun"` — never auto-loaded into
  the type `Env`, no core embed/registry.
- **Tests live here.** rakun's tests are `test { … }` blocks inside its own
  `.bp` files (run by `botopink test`), NOT in the compiler's Zig test suites.
  Wrong-placement *rejection* is covered generically by the compiler's
  annotation-processor suite (a compile-failure can't be a runtime `assert`).
- Keep this file in sync with `docs.md` and the spec in the same change.
